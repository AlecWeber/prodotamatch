# prodotamatch
A simple python script that gives you the most recent professional Dota2 match.

This script uses the OpenDota API to retrieve the latest match and print the results to your terminal.

# Usage

adding the --spoiler argument will display the winner of the match

I also made an alias called 'dota' in my .zshrc that points to the script for easy access.
